# STM32-WITH-MPU6050-INTERFACE
This is a basic flight controller design with STM32 microcontroller with MPU6050 module.The MPU-6050 devices combine a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die, together with an onboard Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™), which processes complex 6-axis MotionFusion algorithms.
